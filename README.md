ArchVis is an experimental architecture visualization project focused on pushing the limits of real-time rendering in the browser using Three.js. This R&D effort explores advanced rendering techniques to achieve high-fidelity, photorealistic scenes for web-based architectural presentations.

🎯 Core Focus:
Improving overall render quality through real-time enhancements in lighting, reflection, post-processing, and color accuracy.

✨ Key Features
🔆 Customizable Lighting System
Flexible light setup including direct, ambient, and spotlights with intensity and color control.

🌗 Day & Night Simulation
Dynamically switch between time-of-day environments to visualize architectural mood and shading.

🌈 Color Space Management
Supports sRGB and linear color spaces with tone mapping and exposure control for more accurate color representation.

🔁 Screen Space Reflections (SSR)
Realistic reflections on surfaces without heavy performance cost.

💫 Post-Processing Effects
Including Bloom, Ambient Occlusion, Depth of Field, and Tone Mapping for cinematic output.

🎚 Gamma Correction
Ensures visual consistency and correct luminance across devices.

🖼 High-Quality Render Pipeline
Optimized render settings with anti-aliasing, texture filtering, and real-time performance tuning.

🧪 Purpose
This project is a sandbox for testing and documenting visual techniques in Three.js that enhance realism, especially for architectural visualization. It aims to be a learning tool and starting point for devs, artists, and studios working on high-end web-based 3D experiences.
